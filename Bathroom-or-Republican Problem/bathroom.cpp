Ptoblem: A Bathroom is being designed for the use of both males and females in a office, but requires the following constraint to maintain:
1. They cannot be men and woman in the bathroom at the same time.
2. There should never be more than three employees in the bathroom simultaneously.

// Starvation is Still Possible

// If multiple male threads arrive consecutively, they will keep entering the bathroom because the condition allows them to go in as long as gender == 'M' or the bathroom is empty (gender == 'N').

// This means that if a female arrives while males keep coming in, she will never get a chance.

// The same issue happens if females keep arriving firstâ€”males may be locked out indefinitely.

// No Consideration for Waiting Males/Females

// There is still no mechanism to track waiting males or females and prioritize the gender that has been waiting longer.

// If there is a mix of males and females waiting, the bathroom will always favor the first one that arrives, leading to starvation for the other gender.

// Bathroom Switch Only When Empty

// The bathroom only resets (gender = 'N') when the last person leaves.

// But if one gender continuously occupies the bathroom without giving the other gender a chance, the waiting gender may never get access.
